# Wordstery

React JS learning project "Wordle" clone
## Must Haves
As A Player I Want To:
- Be able to input letters
- Be challenged to guess a 5 letter word
- Only have 6 attempts
- See a grid (5x6 (5 letter word, 6 attempts))
- Have my attempts checked
- Have feedback in the form of colors (Green, Yellow, Grey)
-- Green = Word contains letter and position
-- Yellow = Word contains letter, but incorrect position
-- Grey = Word does not contain letter

## Nice To Haves
As A Player I Would Like To:
- Share my score, but not reveal word
- 3 New words every day

## Out Of Scope
- Make this into a crime mystery theme

## Definition of Done
- All user stories are tested and accepted by the client.
- 80% unit test coverage
- CI/CD
